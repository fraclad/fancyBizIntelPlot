# Fancy BI Plot 

A repository for codes to construct visualizations common in BI. This project is taking advantage of the basic matplotlib capabilities, but with the addition of my custom styles. E.g all plot titles are left-aligned so that there is no need to google "how to I left align matplotlib figure title". Currently only a few custom plot functions are available but hopefully more to come.

## Examples

1. Waterfall Chart 

   Very common in BI!

   I see this a lot in Bloomberg lol
